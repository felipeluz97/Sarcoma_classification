Silva, FLT et.al (2024)

Note: Tumor infiltrating leucokytes deconvolution and tSNE anlaysis depend on Beta-value matrix generated using Minfi R package (R version 4.3.2)

Methylation analysis to obtain Beta value Matrix, TILs deconvolution, tSNE and Copy Number Alterations were run using R paackages
Fusion genes calling was run in Linux environment (GNU/Linux 6.5.0-21-generic x86_64)
